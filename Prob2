PROBLEM 2: 
 
 Write a program that accepts as input three points (𝑥, 𝑦) lying on a circle in a 2-
dimensional Cartesian plane. The program must return the following parameters of the circle on
which the three points lie:
• center (ℎ, 𝑘);
• radius 𝑟;
• vector [𝐷, 𝐸, 𝐹], where 𝐷, 𝐸, and 𝐹 are the coefficients in the general equation of a circle 
                          𝑥^2 +𝑦^2 + 𝐷𝑥 + 𝐸𝑦 + 𝐹 = 0;

Recall from your analytic geometry/pre-calculus class that the standard and general equations,
respectively, are given as
                          (𝑥 − ℎ)^2 + (𝑦 − 𝑘)^2 = 𝑟^2
                          𝑥^2 + 𝑦^2 + 𝐷𝑥 + 𝐸𝑦 + 𝐹 = 0
